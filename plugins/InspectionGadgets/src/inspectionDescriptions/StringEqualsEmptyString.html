Reports cases when <b>.equals()</b> is called to compare a String with an empty string. In this case, using <b>.isEmpty()</b> is better as
it shows you exactly what you're checking.
<!-- tooltip end -->
<p>
  Some checks, for example, the <b>"".equals(str)</b> check, return false when <b>str</b> is null. It means that an explicit null-check
  could be inserted when you are replacing <b>.equals()</b> with <b>isEmpty()</b>. Use a checkbox below to suppress the warning when a
  string value could be nullable.
